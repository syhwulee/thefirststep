      <h2>What is OCD?</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        OCD, or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, is a type of mental health disorder characterized by <strong>obsessions (intrusive thoughts, impulses, or images) and/or compulsions (repetitive behaviors or rituals) that a person feels driven to perform.</strong> These obsessions and compulsions can be extremely distressing and interfere with a person's ability to carry out normal activities. 
<br><br>
        Common symptoms of OCD include:<br>
        1. <strong>Obsessions:</strong> Intrusive thoughts, impulses, or images that cause anxiety or distress.

        2. <strong>Compulsions:</strong> Repetitive behaviors or rituals that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession.

        3. <strong>Time-consuming:</strong> Obsessions and compulsions can take up a significant amount of time and interfere with a person's ability to carry out normal activities.

        4. <strong>Distressing:</strong> Obsessions and compulsions can be extremely distressing and cause significant anxiety or distress.

        5. <strong>Unwanted:</strong> Obsessions and compulsions are often experienced as unwanted and can be difficult to control.<br><br>
        If you are experiencing obsessions and/or compulsions that are causing significant distress or impairment in your life, <strong>it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.</strong> They can help you understand your symptoms and develop a treatment plan to manage your OCD.

      <h2>Causes of OCD</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        The exact cause of OCD is not fully understood, and it is likely that there are multiple causes of the disorder. <br>Research suggests that OCD may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors.<br><br>

        <strong>Genetic factors:</strong> OCD may have a genetic component, as research has shown that people with a family history of the disorder are more likely to develop OCD.<br>

        <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Environmental factors, such as life stressors or trauma, may contribute to the development of OCD.<br>

        <strong>Psychological factors:</strong> Certain psychological factors, such as perfectionism or a need for control, may also contribute to the development of OCD.<br><br>

        It's important to note that <strong>no single factor causes OCD, and the disorder is not caused by a person's personal characteristics or life circumstances.</strong> If you are concerned that you may have OCD, <strong>it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.</strong> They can help you understand the causes of your disorder and develop a treatment plan to manage your OCD.
