         First of all, <u>we want to congratulate you on taking the first step towards recovery!</u> We understand that getting help seems scary and can produce a lot of uncertainties, and we want to help you in every way we can through our website.
        <br><br>
              <u>Speaking with a loved one or someone you trust is a great place to start.</u> They can provide guidance and support throughout your recovery journey. Many people find speaking to someone who is close to you easier than speaking with a professional.<br>

              <u>For students, it is important to take advantage of the resources provided by your guidance counselor.</u> They <u>understand the challenges</u> that students face and can help you navigate your stressors. <u>Rest assured that confidentiality around speaking with your guidance counselor will be maintained</u> unless there is concern for your well-being.<br>

              However, we recommend you <u>consider receiving professional help, as they will help you understand your feelings and behaviors further.</u> You can contact your primary care doctor who will provide a referral to a mental health professional or offer treatment options.<br><br>

              If you require immediate and urgent help, you can look through our <strong>"Hotlines"</strong> page.<br>

              Another option would be to <u>reach out to a support group.</u> Support groups can provide a safe and supportive environment to discuss your feelings and experiences with others who are going through similar challenges.<br><br>

              Remember, <u>seeking help for a mental health concern is a sign of strength,</u> and it takes courage to reach out for support. Don't hesitate to seek help if you need it.
