      <h2>What is PTSD?</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        PTSD, or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, is a type of mental health disorder that can <strong>develop after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event.</strong> Traumatic events can include natural disasters, accidents, sexual or physical abuse, military combat, or other life-threatening events.<br>
        PTSD can manifest differently in different people, and the specific symptoms a person experiences may vary depending on their individual experiences and circumstances. However, there are a few different types of PTSD that are commonly recognized: <strong>acute PTSD, chronic PTSD, and delayed-onset PTSD.</strong><br>
        It's important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and a person with PTSD may experience symptoms from more than one category. 
<br><br>
        Common symptoms of PTSD include:<br>
        1. <strong>Re-experiencing:</strong> Recurrent and intrusive memories of the traumatic event, nightmares, flashbacks, or intense distress when exposed to reminders of the event.
        <br>
        2. <strong>Avoidance:</strong> Avoiding thoughts, feelings, or situations that are reminders of the traumatic event.
        <br>
        3. <strong>Negative changes in thoughts and feelings:</strong> Negative changes in beliefs and feelings about oneself or others, difficulty experiencing positive emotions, and an inability to remember important aspects of the traumatic event.
        <br>
        4. <strong>Arousal and reactivity:</strong> Difficulty sleeping, irritability, anger, hyper-vigilance, and an exaggerated startle response.
        <br>
        <br>PTSD can have a significant impact on a person's quality of life, and <strong>it is important to seek treatment if you are experiencing symptoms of the disorder.</strong> Treatment for PTSD often includes therapy and medication.

      <h2>Causes of PTSD</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        PTSD can develop after a person experiences or witnesses a traumatic event. Traumatic events can include natural disasters, accidents, sexual or physical abuse, military combat, or other life-threatening events. <br>Not everyone who experiences a traumatic event will develop PTSD, and the likelihood of developing the disorder may be influenced by a number of factors, including:
<br><br>
        <strong>The severity of the traumatic event:</strong> More severe traumatic events, such as military combat or sexual assault, are more likely to lead to the development of PTSD.
<br>
        <strong>Personal characteristics:</strong> Certain personal characteristics, such as having a history of mental health problems or a lack of social support, may increase the likelihood of developing PTSD after a traumatic event.
<br>
        <strong>The individual's response to the traumatic event:</strong> People who experience intense fear, helplessness, or horror during a traumatic event may be more likely to develop PTSD.

      <h2>Types of PTSD</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        <strong>Acute PTSD</strong>
        <br>
        Acute PTSD is a type of PTSD that is diagnosed when symptoms of the disorder last for <strong>less than three months. </strong>Acute PTSD is often the <strong>most severe form </strong>of the disorder and may require intensive treatment in order to effectively manage the symptoms.
<br><br>
        <strong>Chronic PTSD</strong>
        <br>
        Chronic PTSD is a type of PTSD that is diagnosed when symptoms of the disorder last for <strong>more than three months. </strong>Chronic PTSD may be less severe than acute PTSD, but it can still have a significant impact on a person's quality of life and may require ongoing treatment in order to effectively manage the symptoms.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Delayed-onset PTSD</strong>
        <br>
        Delayed-onset PTSD is a type of PTSD that is diagnosed when <strong>symptoms of the disorder do not appear until at least six months after the traumatic event.</strong> Delayed-onset PTSD may be more <strong>difficult to diagnose,</strong> as the symptoms may not be immediately apparent and may be mistaken for other mental health disorders.
