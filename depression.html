      <h2>What is Depression?</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        Depression is a type of mental health disorder characterized by <strong>persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities.</strong> Depression can also cause a range of physical and emotional symptoms, such as changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt. <br>
        Depression can interfere with a person's ability to carry out normal activities and can impact their quality of life. <strong>It's important to seek treatment for depression if you are experiencing persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities that are causing significant distress or impairment in your life.</strong> Treatment for depression often includes therapy and medication.
<br><br>
        Common symptoms of Depression include:<br>
        1. <strong>Persistent feelings</strong> of sadness, hopelessness, and emptiness<br>
        2. Loss of interest in activities that were previously enjoyable<br>
        3. Changes in appetite and weight<br>
        4. Changes in sleep patterns<br>
        5. Difficulty concentrating or making decisions<br>
        6. Fatigue or low energy<br>
        7. Feelings of worthlessness or guilt<br>
        8. Thoughts of death or suicide<br>
        9. Restlessness or irritability<br><br>
        If you are experiencing symptoms of depression that are causing significant distress or impairment in your life, <strong>it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.</strong> They can help you understand your symptoms and develop a treatment plan to manage your depression.

      <h2>Causes of Depression</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        The exact cause of depression is not fully understood, and it is likely that there are multiple causes of the disorder. <br>Research suggests that depression may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors.<br><br>

        <strong>Genetic factors:</strong> Depression may have a genetic component, as research has shown that people with a family history of the disorder are more likely to develop depression.<br>

        <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Life events, such as a major life change, loss, or stress, can trigger depression.<br>

        <strong>Psychological factors:</strong> Certain psychological factors, such as negative thinking patterns or a lack of social support, may also contribute to the development of depression.<br>
        
        <strong>Physical factors:</strong> Some medical conditions, such as an under-active thyroid or certain medications, can cause symptoms of depression.<br><br>

        It's important to note that <strong>no single factor causes depression, and the disorder is not caused by a person's personal characteristics or life circumstances.</strong> If you are concerned that you may have depression, <strong>it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.</strong> They can help you understand the causes of your depression and develop a treatment plan to manage the disorder.

  <h1>Depression vs. Sadness</h1>
  <p class="p-info"><strong>Sadness</strong> is a normal emotion that everyone experiences from time to time. It is a natural response to loss, disappointment, or other life challenges, and it is usually temporary. Sadness is a normal part of life, and it can often be managed with the support of family and friends, self-care activities, and healthy coping strategies.<br><br>
    <strong>Depression,</strong> on the other hand, is a type of mental health disorder characterized by <strong>persistent feelings</strong> of sadness, hopelessness, and a loss of interest in activities. Depression can also cause a range of physical and emotional symptoms, such as <strong>changes in appetite, sleep patterns, and energy levels, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of worthlessness or guilt.</strong> Depression can interfere with a person's ability to carry out normal activities and can impact their quality of life.<br><br>

    It's important to note that while everyone experiences sadness at some point, <strong>it becomes a disorder when it is persistent and difficult to manage, and when it interferes with a person's ability to function in their daily life.</strong> If you are experiencing symptoms of depression that are causing significant distress or impairment in your life, <strong>it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.</strong> They can help you understand your symptoms and develop a treatment plan to manage your depression.</p><br><br>
