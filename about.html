  I am a junior at Wayland High School in Massachusetts. In 2022, I had the idea to create a website called The First Step, inspired by my personal experiences with mental health. I recognized the need for a support system that was anonymous and accessible to all. With the help of some close friends, I developed The First Step as a platform for teenagers to find resources and support in their recovery journey, as well as a place to share their stories and express themselves freely. My goal is to raise awareness and create a safe and welcoming community for teenagers.</p>

  I am a junior at Wayland High School. I am passionate about supporting teenage mental health and have personally experienced and witnessed the struggles that come with it. In my free time, I enjoy reading, journaling, practicing martial arts, and watching television. Although I tend to procrastinate in school, I am able to maintain satisfactory grades.</p>

  I am a junior at Wayland High School. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the flute, singing, swimming, and playing volleyball. Over the past few years, I have faced numerous challenges due to the Covid-19 pandemic, as have many of my friends. We have all had our ups and downs, and it is important to support one another during these times. I believe that as a global community, we should all strive to lift each other up and offer support to those in need.</p>

  I am a junior at Wayland High School. In my free time, I enjoy playing volleyball with friends, making crafts, and playing the piano. Although I have not received a formal diagnosis, I have struggled with anxiety and depression in the past. My goal for this website is to provide support and guidance to other teenagers who may be struggling with their mental health, and to encourage them to seek professional help when they are ready.</p>
