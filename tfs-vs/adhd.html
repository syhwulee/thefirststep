      <h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurological disorder that affects a person's ability to pay attention, control impulsive behaviors, and sit still for long periods of time. It is a common condition, especially in children, and it can continue into adulthood.
<br><br>
        Common symptoms of ADHD include:<br>
        1. <strong>Difficulty paying attention:</strong> People with ADHD may have trouble paying attention to details, following instructions, and completing tasks.
        <br>
        2. <strong>Impulsivity:</strong> People with ADHD may act impulsively, without considering the consequences of their actions.
        <br>
        3. <strong>Restlessness:</strong> People with ADHD may have difficulty sitting still and may fidget or squirm in their seat.
        <br>
        4. <strong>Difficulty controlling physical movement:</strong> Children with ADHD may have trouble controlling their physical movement and may be constantly "on the go."
        <br>
        5. <strong>Forgetfulness:</strong> People with ADHD may have difficulty remembering details and may have trouble organizing their thoughts and tasks.
        <br>
        6. <strong>Difficulty with time management:</strong> People with ADHD may have trouble managing their time and may have difficulty following schedules.
        <br>
        <br>These symptoms can vary in severity and may interfere with a person's ability to function in daily life, including school, work, and relationships. It is important to work with a healthcare professional to accurately diagnose and treat ADHD, as treatment can greatly improve quality of life and functioning.

      <h2>Causes of ADHD</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        The exact cause of ADHD is not fully understood, and it is likely that there are multiple causes of the disorder.
<br>
        Research suggests that ADHD may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors.
<br><br>
        <strong>Genetic factors:</strong> ADHD tends to run in families, and research has shown that people with a family history of the disorder are more likely to develop ADHD.
<br>
        <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Environmental factors, such as premature birth, exposure to toxins, or alcohol or tobacco use during pregnancy, may increase the risk of developing ADHD.
<br>
        <strong>Neurological factors:</strong> Research has also suggested that there may be differences in the brain structure and functioning of people with ADHD.
<br><br>
        It's important to note that no single factor causes ADHD, and the disorder is not caused by a person's personal characteristics or life circumstances. If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have ADHD, it's important to seek help from a mental health professional. They can help you understand the causes of the disorder and develop a treatment plan to manage ADHD.

      <h2>Types of ADHD</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        <strong>Predominantly Inattentive ADHD</strong>
        <br>
        Predominantly inattentive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a subtype of ADHD characterized by difficulty paying attention, following instructions, and completing tasks. It is also known as ADHD, predominantly inattentive type.
<br>
        People with predominantly inattentive ADHD <strong>may have trouble staying organized, following through on tasks, and completing assignments.</strong> They may forget details, have difficulty paying attention to details, and be easily distracted. They may also have difficulty following instructions and may struggle to finish tasks that require sustained mental effort.
<br>
        Predominantly inattentive ADHD is often overlooked or misdiagnosed because the symptoms may be less obvious than those of the other two subtypes of ADHD, hyperactive-impulsive type and combined type. <strong>It is important to work with a healthcare professional to accurately diagnose and treat ADHD, as treatment can greatly improve quality of life and functioning.</strong> Treatment may include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive ADHD</strong>
        <br>
        Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a subtype of ADHD characterized by difficulty sitting still, controlling impulsive behaviors, and making decisions. It is also known as ADHD, predominantly hyperactive/impulsive type.
<br>
        People with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD <strong>may have difficulty sitting still, controlling their movements, and waiting their turn.</strong> They may be impulsive, acting without thinking about the consequences of their actions, and may have difficulty controlling their impulses. They may also have difficulty making decisions, as they may act impulsively without considering the long-term consequences.
<br>
        Predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD is often more obvious than predominantly inattentive ADHD, as the symptoms are more noticeable and disruptive to daily life. <strong>It is important to work with a healthcare professional to accurately diagnose and treat ADHD, as treatment can greatly improve quality of life and functioning.</strong> Treatment may include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Combined Hyperactive-Impulsive & Inattentive ADHD</strong>
        <br>
        Combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a subtype of ADHD that <strong>involves symptoms of both predominantly hyperactive-impulsive type and predominantly inattentive type.</strong> People with this subtype of ADHD <strong>may have difficulty paying attention, following instructions, and completing tasks, as well as difficulty sitting still, controlling impulsive behaviors, and making decisions.</strong>
<br>
        Combined ADHD is the <strong>most common</strong> subtype of ADHD, and it is often characterized by a combination of inattention and hyperactive-impulsive symptoms. These symptoms can interfere with a person's ability to function in daily life, including school, work, and relationships.
<br>
        <strong>It is important to work with a healthcare professional to accurately diagnose and treat ADHD, as treatment can greatly improve quality of life and functioning.</strong> Treatment may include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.
