      <h2>What is Bipolar Disorder?</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        Bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, is a type of mental health disorder that <strong>affects a person's mood, energy, and ability to function.</strong> People with bipolar disorder experience extreme mood swings that can range from periods of high energy and euphoria (manic episodes) to periods of low energy and depression (depressive episodes). <strong>The severity and duration of these mood episodes can vary from person to person.</strong><br>
        <strong>During a manic episode,</strong> a person with bipolar disorder may have an elevated or irritable mood, have increased energy and activity levels, and may engage in risky or impulsive behaviors.<strong>During a depressive episode,</strong> a person may have a low mood, loss of interest in activities, changes in sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of worthlessness or hopelessness.<br>
        Bipolar disorder can interfere with a person's ability to carry out normal activities and can impact their quality of life. <strong>It's important to seek treatment for bipolar disorder if you are experiencing extreme mood swings or changes in energy and activity levels that are causing significant distress or impairment in your life.</strong> Treatment for bipolar disorder often includes therapy and medication.
<br><br>
        Common symptoms of Bipolar Disorder include:<br>
        1. <strong>Mood swings,</strong> including periods of high energy and euphoria (manic episodes) and periods of low energy and depression (depressive episodes)<br>

        3. <strong>Difficulty with daily activities,</strong> such as eating and bathing<br>
        4. Changes in sleep patterns<br>
        5. Changes in appetite<br>

      <h2>Causes of Bipolar Disorder</h2>
      <div class="hidden-text3">
        The exact cause of bipolar disorder is not fully understood, and it is likely that there are multiple causes of the disorder. <br>Research suggests that bipolar disorder may be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurological factors.<br><br>

        <strong>Genetic factors:</strong> Bipolar disorder tends to run in families, and research has shown that people with a family history of the disorder are more likely to develop bipolar disorder.<br>

        <strong>Environmental factors:</strong> Environmental factors, such as life stressors or trauma, may contribute to the development of bipolar disorder.<br>

        <strong>Neurological factors:</strong> Research has also suggested that there may be differences in the brain structure and functioning of people with bipolar disorder.<br><br>

        It's important to note that <strong>no single factor causes bipolar disorder, and the disorder is not caused by a person's personal characteristics or life circumstances.</strong> If you are concerned that you or a loved one may have bipolar disorder, <strong>it's important to seek help from a mental health professional.</strong> They can help you understand the causes of the disorder and develop a treatment plan to manage bipolar disorder.
